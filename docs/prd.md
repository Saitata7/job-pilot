# Jobs Pilot - Product Requirements Document

## Vision

Jobs Pilot is a local-first AI Job Assistant Chrome extension that transforms the job application process from tedious manual work into an intelligent, personalized experience. It combines the automation of tools like Simplify with the AI-powered customization of RightJob, while keeping all data private on the user's machine.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Self-improving system** that learns from application outcomes automatically
- **Platform-specific ATS optimization** for maximum matching scores
- **Humanized content generation** that doesn't sound AI-generated
- **Token-efficient architecture** that uses AI only where truly needed

## Problem Statement

Job seekers face several challenges:
1. **Repetitive data entry**: Re-entering the same information across hundreds of applications
2. **One-size-fits-all resumes**: Using generic resumes instead of tailored versions for each role
3. **No tracking**: Losing track of which jobs they've applied to and their status
4. **Poor job fit assessment**: Wasting time applying to mismatched roles
5. **Generic cover letters**: Sending template cover letters that don't resonate
6. **ATS rejection**: Getting filtered out by automated systems before a human sees the resume
7. **AI-sounding content**: Generated content that's obviously written by AI

Existing solutions either:
- Require cloud storage of sensitive personal data (privacy concern)
- Lack AI-powered customization
- Don't learn from user behavior over time
- Generate obvious AI content that hurts applications
- Don't understand different ATS platforms

## Solution

Jobs Pilot addresses these problems with:

### Core Features

1. **Master Profile System**
   - Upload resume (PDF/DOCX) for deep AI analysis
   - Extract career context, skills with proficiency levels, and accomplishments
   - Identify target roles with fit scores
   - Generate role-specific profiles automatically
   - Build answer bank for common application questions

2. **Platform-Specific ATS Optimization**
   - **Greenhouse**: Frequency-based matching (repeat keywords 2-3x)
   - **Lever**: Semantic matching (understands synonyms, tenses)
   - **Workday**: Exact phrase matching (strictest - copy from JD)
   - **Taleo/iCIMS**: Hybrid matching with skills extraction
   - Automatic strategy selection based on detected platform

3. **Hybrid ATS Scoring (Cost-Efficient)**
   - **Layer 1 (Instant/Free)**: Keyword matching, skills overlap, format check

   - Only use AI when user wants detailed analysis

4. **Self-Improving Learning Engine**
   - Automatically tracks application outcomes (response, interview, offer)
   - Learns which keywords lead to callbacks per platform
   - Identifies patterns in successful applications
   - Provides increasingly personalized recommendations
   - **No user intervention required** - learns silently in background

   - Adds natural variations and human touches
   - Confidence scoring for AI detection
   - Makes generated content indistinguishable from human writing

7. **Smart Autofill with Approval**
   - Detect application form fields
   - Map profile data to form fields

9. **Application Outcome Tracking**
   - Track all applications automatically
   - Status workflow: Applied → Viewed → Interview → Offer/Rejected
   - Auto-mark stale applications as "no response" after 2 weeks
   - Calculate response rates, interview rates per platform
   - Weekly trend analysis

10. **Auto-Improvement Recommendations**
    - Generate improvement suggestions automatically

2. **Engagement**: User generates 3+ tailored applications
3. **Learning**: System has 10+ tracked applications with outcomes
4. **Retention**: User returns within 7 days
5. **Efficiency**: 50% time reduction per application
6. **Quality**: 20% higher response rate vs generic applications

## Out of Scope (v1)

- Mobile app

- Direct application submission (always manual)
- Cloud sync between devices
- Team/enterprise features
- Interview preparation features

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Job site structure changes | Modular detector architecture, easy to update |
| AI rate limits | Local Ollama option, Layer 1 instant scoring, caching |
| User enters sensitive data | Clear warnings, local-only storage, no cloud |
| Form filling breaks site | Preview/approval flow, conservative field detection |
| AI content sounds robotic | Humanizer module removes AI patterns |
| Learning needs data volume | Graceful degradation, show "need more data" messaging |
